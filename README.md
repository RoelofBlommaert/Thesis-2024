Hi there!

This repository is meant for my thesis in marketing Management '24. In this repo, I will share my data and code needed for video analysis of YouTube advertisements.

# In this repo you will find:

## 1. Python files that are meant for video analysis, data visualization and main regression analysis

[Video unctions.py]([url](https://github.com/RoelofBlommaert/Thesis-2024/blob/main/Video_functions.py)) is a file that consists of all feature complexity function definitions
## 2. A file with downloaded mp.4 videos, which is a list of downloaded YouTube videos that will be ingested by the ingestion script for further analysis.
## 3. Youtube data, which consists of dependent variables and control variables gathered with the Youtube API.
## 4. Video data, consisting of the visual complexity and motion variety scores for each video.
## 5. A total feature matrix file, which has all Youtube and Video data in a combined file for regression analysis.
