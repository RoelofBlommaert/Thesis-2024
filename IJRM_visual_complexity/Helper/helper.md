1. June01, the code was provided by the authors of "Measuring Visual Clutter" - Ruth Rosenholtz, Yuanzhen Li and Lisa Nakano: 
http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/37593

"This MATLAB software implements two measures of visual clutter described in our Journal of Vision 2007 paper in the special issue on crowding. The remaining measure described in that paper, Edge Density, is only two lines of MATLAB code and is fully described in the paper, so we do not include that code here. To run this software, you will likely need to download an updated version of Simoncelli's Steerable Pyramid software, available here: http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/steerpyr/"

"Superpixel-based-Fast-Fuzzy-C-Means-Clustering-for-Color-Image-Segmentation
The authors propose a superpixel-based fast FCM (SFFCM) for color image segmentation. The proposed algorithm is able to achieve color image segmentation with a very low computational cost, yet achieve a high segmentation precision.

This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems."
