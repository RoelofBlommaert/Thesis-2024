# Simplicity is not Key: Understanding Firm-Generated Social Media Images and Consumer Liking
This repository includes the code for extracting the image features used in the paper: "Simplicity is not Key: Understanding Firm-Generated Social Media Images and Consumer Liking.

## Main Script 
main.m is the script used to extract all visual complexity measures, photography control measures from Zhang et al. (2017) and Zhang and Luo (2018), and alternative complexity measures from various sources. 


## Helper Functions and Sources utilized
The HELPER folder has various resources that were either collected from their respective websites and github pages. For the design complexity - object arrangement extraction to work, the instructions provided here ( http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/37593 ) have to be followed. The files are in the Helper/June01/ directory, but might require compiling once downloaded. 

The sources that were used either by using code directly or through inspiration are the following (see paper for more details):
